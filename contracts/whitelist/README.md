# Overview

This contract acts as a module that controls "whitelist" minting campaigns for NFT collections.  A creator is allowed to set start and end times for whitelist mints, control addresses that are allowed to mint during this part of a mint, price (prohibited by the main contract's preferred denom), and max per address mint count.  Whitelist mints have a hard stop once the minter's public mint start time begins.
